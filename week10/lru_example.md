### Assume we have 6 virtual memory pages and 4 physical memory pages and are using a least-recently-used (LRU) replacement strategy.

What will happen if these virtual memory pages were accessed, each one second apart?

```
5 3 5 3 0 1 2 2 3 5
```

Here's our 4 physical pages over time ('inverted page table'):
```
initially empty.
