# Q15-18: IO
### Q15: How many different values can fgetc return?
- a byte might be between 0 and 255 -> 256 values
- or it could be EOF, typically -1 -> an extra value
- 257 values that fgetc can return
- but the char data type can only support 256 values
- need to use an integer to store fgetc's result

### Q16: Why are the names of fgetc, fputc, getc, putc, putchar, and getchar misleading?
characters, as we've thought of them, often refer to ascii values, which have values between 0 to 127.
the character i/o family actually read in bytes, not just ascii characters. bytes may have values between 0 to 255, representing other things, such as potentially unicode.

we can use `hexdump -C` or `xxd` to visualise bytes of files as hex

### Q17: For each of the following calls to the fopen() library function, give an open() system call that has equivalent semantics relative to the state of the file.

(Note that fopen returns a pointer to a file stream, which abstracts the file away, while the open system call returns a file descriptor.)

* fopen(FilePath, "r")
* fopen(FilePath, "a")
* fopen(FilePath, "w")
* fopen(FilePath, "r+")
* fopen(FilePath, "w+")

Use `man 3 fopen` and scroll to the table.

### Q18: What is `lseek(2)` or `fseek(3)`? When is it useful, and what does it return?

```c
FILE *stream = fopen("somefile", "r");
fseek(stream, 1000, SEEK_SET);
// file offset is 1000.
fseek(stream, -500, SEEK_CUR);

fseek(stream, -10, SEEK_END);
```
