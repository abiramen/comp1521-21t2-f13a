### Links to the children of a given directory are stored as entries in the directory structure. Where is the link to the **parent** directory stored?
`..`

### What kind of filesystem object is cat?

- dev directory contains **devices**
- tty: teletypewriter
    - a physical device representing a terminal
    - c: character device ('byte device')
    - /dev/pts: pseudo-tty inside a terminal emulator


### What kind of filesystem object is a symbolic link? What value does it contain?
- symbolic links are like 'shortcuts'
- shows as l under `ls -l`
- we can see where the symlink goes in `ls -l`
- symlink just contains the path to where the symlink points to

### Symbolic links change the filesystem from a tree structure to a graph structure. How do they do this?
- links can go anywhere
