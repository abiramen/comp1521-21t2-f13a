# Q4: Understanding files from `ls` output
Consider the following output from an `ls -l` command.
```
drwxr-x--- 11 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Aug 27 11:59 17s2.work
drwxr-xr-x  2 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Aug 20 13:20 bin
-rw-r-----  1 cs1521 cs1521   38 Jul 20 14:28 give.spec
drwxr-xr-x  3 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Aug 20 13:20 lib
drwxr-x--x  3 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Jul 20 10:58 public_html
drwxr-xr-x 12 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Aug 13 17:31 spim
drwxr-x---  2 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Sep  4 15:18 tmp
lrwxrwxrwx  1 cs1521 cs1521   11 Jul 16 18:33 web -> public_html
```
### Who can access the 17s2.work directory?
cs1521 (user) and cs1521(group) can read and explore the directory

### What operations can a typical user (that is, someone not part of the cs1521 group) perform on the public_html directory?
They can explore the directory.

### What is the file web?
The file is a symlink to the public_html directory.

### What is the difference between stat("web", &info) and lstat("web", &info)?
stat follows the symlink, while lstat gives us information about the symlink object itself.

## Folder permissions
r: able to read directory entries (run ls)
w: able to write to the directory
x: able to cd into the directory, and actually access the contents -> 'explore' instead of 'execute'
