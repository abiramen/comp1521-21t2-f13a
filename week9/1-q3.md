# Q3: `stat` and `lstat`

The `stat()` and `lstat()` functions both take an argument which is a pointer to a `struct stat` object, and fill it with the metadata for a named file.

On Linux, some of the fields in `struct stat` include:

```c
struct stat {
    ino_t st_ino;         /* inode number */
    mode_t st_mode;       /* protection */
    uid_t st_uid;         /* user ID of owner */
    gid_t st_gid;         /* group ID of owner */
    off_t st_size;        /* total size, in bytes */
    blksize_t st_blksize; /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
    blkcnt_t st_blocks;   /* number of 512B blocks allocated */
    time_t st_atime;      /* time of last access */
    time_t st_mtime;      /* time of last modification */
    time_t st_ctime;      /* time of last status change */
};
```

Explain what each field represents, and explain what value we might get if we used stat on `quality-content.txt`.

## Inodes (index nodes)
- most Linux systems use a file system called ext4
- objects part of the file system which store additional information about files
